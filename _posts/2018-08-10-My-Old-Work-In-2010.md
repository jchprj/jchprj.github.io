I usually organize my old work, here is one of my old work in 2010: some path finding algorithm.  

It was neither first time nor last time I got into path finding related algorithm. At first, I used to think and implement on my own. Gradually, I found more and more related resources. 

I still have very profound impressions about the concepts such as map, array, traversal although I'm not using it recently.
